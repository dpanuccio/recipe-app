# Recipe Search Application

## Description

This is my first project since completing the IBM Full-Stack Software Developer Course.

This Recipe Search Application allows users to search for recipes based on ingredients and view details about each recipe. It uses the Edamam API to fetch recipes and provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the data.

## Features

- Search for recipes by ingredient
